# Mail Ops Skill (邮件运维工程师 Skill)

## Overview

Use this skill to perform mailbox operations through the bundled local scripts, not an external MCP server. All outgoing mail is HTML. Deletion is two-tier: **soft delete (move to Trash) is the default; hard delete is only permitted on UIDs that already live in the Trash folder.**

Supported providers: `gmail`, `qq`, `custom`.

## Quick Start

1. Classify the request as one of:
   - account setup or repair
   - mailbox lookup or reading
   - attachment download
   - drafting or sending
   - deletion / restoration
2. Read only the reference file you need:
   - provider and setup rules: `references/providers.md`
   - attachment storage behavior: `references/storage.md`
   - HTML writing style and send rules: `references/writing-style.md`
   - **deletion safety rules: `references/safety.md`**
   - machine-facing local tool-call contract: `references/tool-calls.md`
3. Use `scripts/mail_tools.sh <tool_name> --input-json '<json>'` for deterministic execution.
4. Use `scripts/mail_client.sh <command>` for a human-facing CLI.

## Workflow Rules

### Account Setup Or Repair

- Start with `doctor_account` when config state is unknown.
- Run `migrate_config` before any mailbox operation if the config is still `v1`.
- Use `setup_account` to create or update mailbox settings.
- Run `test_login` after credential or server changes.

### Mailbox Lookup Or Reading

- Use `search_messages` when the user provides keywords, sender hints, or subject clues.
- Use `list_messages` when the user wants recent mail or the request is vague.
- Use `get_message` only after you have a specific `UID`.

### Attachment Download

- Use `download_attachments` only after confirming the right `UID`.
- Default to `mode="temp"`.
- Use `mode="archive"` only when the user explicitly wants long-lived storage.

### Local File Registration

- Use `register_attachments` when the user wants to send local files (not downloaded from mailbox) as attachments.
- This registers the files in the approval manifest (`.codex-mail-attachments.json`) so `send_email` can accept them.
- Pass one or more file paths via the `files` parameter (string or string array).
- The tool validates each file exists and is not a symlink before registering.
- After registration, the files can be passed to `send_email`'s `attachments` parameter.
- Example flow: `register_attachments` → `send_email` with the same paths.

### Drafting Or Sending

- Use `draft_email` to generate a local HTML draft.
- Use `send_email` only when the sending account, recipients, subject, HTML body, and attachment paths are clear.
- **Attachment requirement:** Files passed to `send_email`'s `attachments` parameter must be in an approved directory (with a `.codex-mail-attachments.json` manifest). Files from `download_attachments` are auto-registered. For local files, call `register_attachments` first.
- Use `send_scheduled_email` when the user asks for delayed delivery. It calls the Resend API with a `scheduled_at` timestamp; no local AI or OS scheduler is required.
  - Resend API Key 优先从 sender.resend_api_key 读取，回退 `RESEND_API_KEY` 环境变量。
  - 未传 `to` 时自动使用 main 收件人。
  - When the domain is not yet verified at Resend, `from` defaults to `onboarding@resend.dev` and recipients are restricted to the registered email address.
- **All outgoing mail is HTML.** Compose the body with inline CSS so QQ Mail renders fonts, sizes, weights, colors, and backgrounds faithfully. Plain-text fallback is derived automatically — do not author it.
- Use inline images (`cid:`) for custom emoji; Unicode emoji can go straight in the HTML.
- Use `ics_event` / `ics_file` to attach a calendar invite when the user asks for a schedule.
- Apply the send checks in `references/writing-style.md` before every `send_email` call.

### Deletion / Restoration — SAFETY CRITICAL

**Before any delete call, you MUST:**

1. Identify candidate UIDs with `list_messages` / `search_messages`, read details with `get_message` if needed, and **show the list (UID, date, from, subject) to the user**.
2. Ask the user yes/no. Wait for an affirmative reply in this turn. A previous "yes" does **not** carry over to new batches.
3. Call the delete tool with `confirmed=true` only after that fresh affirmative reply. With `confirmed=false` (the default) the tool returns a `preview` and makes no changes — use this to satisfy step 1 when convenient.

**Two-tier model (enforced by the tool layer):**

- `trash_messages` — soft delete; moves UIDs from any folder to the Trash. **This is the default delete path.** After success, tell the user the Trash folder name and that `restore_messages` can recover them.
- `restore_messages` — moves UIDs from Trash back to a target folder (default `INBOX`).
- `purge_messages` — hard delete, **only accepts UIDs that are already in the Trash folder**. The tool rejects UIDs it cannot reach in Trash, so there is no "INBOX → permanent delete" path. The user must explicitly use words like "硬删 / 彻底删除 / 不可恢复 / purge" to unlock this tool.

**Never** call `purge_messages` on your own initiative; never bundle it with an initial "delete" request. The canonical flow is: `trash_messages` → (user reviews Trash) → optional `purge_messages` only if the user says so.

All delete / restore / purge operations append a JSONL entry to `config/audit.log`（项目根目录下） automatically; you do not need to maintain that log, but you may reference it when the user asks "what did I delete recently".

## Output Rules

- For `list_messages` / `search_messages`, lead with `UID`, date, sender, subject.
- For `get_message`, summarize first; expand only on request.
- For `download_attachments`, report mode, target dir, saved filenames.
- For `register_attachments`, report each registered file path and directory; list any errors.
- For `trash_messages` success: say **"已移至回收站『<name>』，可通过 `restore_messages` 恢复"**.
- For `purge_messages` success: say **"已永久删除，无法恢复"**.
- For any `preview` return (confirmed=false), present the message list and ask for confirmation; do not re-run with confirmed=true in the same turn without a fresh user yes.
- Do not present unsupported providers or external-only workflows as available options.
